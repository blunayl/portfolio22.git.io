            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>At 21 years old, my name is Blen Daniel, hailing from the vibrant city of Addis Ababa, where I spent my formative years and received my education at Cruise School. 
                    The world of technology has always intrigued me since my early encounters with computers. I found myself captivated by their ability to transform ideas into reality through programming languages and algorithms.
                     It was this fascination that propelled me towards choosing computer science as my academic pursuit. 
                     The endless possibilities of innovation and problem-solving that the field offers, coupled with the rapidly evolving nature of technology, inspired me to delve deeper into this domain. 
                     I envision myself contributing to groundbreaking advancements, developing solutions that address real-world challenges, 
                    and leaving a meaningful impact on society through my knowledge and expertise in computer science.

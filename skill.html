  As a passionate computer science student named Blen with a penchant for creativity, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and digital drawing. Proficient in HTML, I excel in creating structured and semantically correct web pages. My expertise allows me to build the foundational structure of websites, incorporating elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. I prioritize clean and accessible code, ensuring compatibility across various browsers and devices.
  In CSS, I thrive in transforming the aesthetics of web pages. My knowledge extends to utilizing CSS for styling and layout purposes, enabling me to craft visually appealing and responsive designs. From adjusting colors, fonts, and layouts to employing advanced techniques like flexbox and grid, I am adept at breathing life into static HTML structures.
